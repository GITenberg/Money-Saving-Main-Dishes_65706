<p>This is easy to answer after you have decided on the main dish.</p>
<p>The main dish is especially important in meal planning. It is the hub around which
the rest of the meal is built, and often it carries a large proportion of the cost of the
meal. Usually the main dish is the main source of protein&mdash;so essential to building
and repairing body tissues.</p>
<p>In this booklet are recipes and suggestions for about 150 main dishes&mdash;easy to make,
hearty, and economical. Most of the dishes give four liberal servings; a few provide
more.</p>
<p>Most of these main dishes furnish about a fourth of the day&rsquo;s needs for protein. For
those that provide less, additional protein foods are specified in the menu suggestion
following the recipe. Or you may prefer to increase the amount of protein-rich food
in the main dish&mdash;by adding more meat, for instance, to a main-dish soup, salad, or
casserole. The rest of the day&rsquo;s protein will come from milk used as a beverage, and
from cereals, bread, and other foods eaten as part of the day&rsquo;s meals.</p>
<p>You get top-rating proteins (as well as other important nutrients) in foods from
animal sources, as in meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk, cheese. Some of these protein
foods are needed each day; and it is an advantage to include some in each meal.</p>
<p>Next best for proteins are soybeans and nuts and dry beans and peas. When these
or grain products are featured in main dishes, try to combine them with a little top-rating
protein food, if you can.</p>
<p>No one food is exactly like any other food and no food is complete in all nutrients.
Milk products are high in calcium; meats are low. Meat, poultry, eggs, and beans
are good sources of iron; milk is low in it. One kind of B vitamin abounds in meats,
another in milk, and a third in whole grains. The best way to be sure of a good
diet is to use a variety of main dishes and wide choices of other foods to complete
the meal.</p>
<h4>Main-dish Proteins From a Variety of Sources</h4>
<p>To supply a fourth of the day&rsquo;s protein requirement, a main dish for a family of
four must contain about 2 ounces of protein. Although this averages &frac12; ounce (15
grams) per person, it will not necessarily be divided equally among the family
members&mdash;men and teen-age boys and girls will need somewhat more; women and
younger children, somewhat less. There follows a list of foods commonly used in
main dishes, together with the quantity needed to provide the &frac12; ounce of protein.</p>

<h4>A Daily Food Guide</h4>
<p>As you plan your main dishes, do your overall menu planning too, keeping in mind
the different kinds of foods that are needed for an adequate diet. Plan to serve foods
from each of these four groups every day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8226; Milk group&mdash;milk in all forms (fluid whole or skim, evaporated, dry, buttermilk).
For children, the equivalent of 3 or more cups of fluid milk daily; for teenagers, 4 or
more cups; for adults, 2 or more cups.</p>
<p>&#8226; Meat group&mdash;meat, poultry, fish, eggs; as alternates, dry beans, peas, and lentils;
nuts, peanuts, peanut butter. Two or more servings daily.</p>
<p>&#8226; Vegetable-fruit group&mdash;vegetables and fruits of all kinds. Four or more servings,
including a citrus fruit or other fruit or vegetable important for vitamin C daily and
a dark-green or deep-yellow vegetable for vitamin A at least every other day.</p>
<p>&#8226; Bread-cereal group&mdash;all breads and cereals that are whole grain, enriched, or
restored. Four or more servings daily.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other foods&mdash;the fats and oils, sugars, and unenriched cereal products used in
cooking or added to foods at the table&mdash;will help to round out meals and satisfy
appetites.</p>
<p>Looking at our national diet, we find that nearly half of our protein comes from
the meat group. But about a fifth comes from bread and other cereal foods. And the
milk group provides about a fourth.</p>
<p>We can then rely on these three food groups to provide the protein of our main
dishes. We need not have protein-deficient diets even if we economize on meat.
For we can get protein from other foods, using them as suggested in the money-saving
recipes given in this booklet.</p>
<h4>Meals to Suit the Family</h4>
<p>Foods to serve with the main dishes are suggested at the end of each recipe. Choices
will depend on available supplies, cost, the season, and what the family likes. If the
protein in the main dish is limited, care should be taken to include in the meal the
other protein-rich foods suggested in the menu (such as salads or desserts containing
egg or milk) or dishes equally high in protein, to raise the total protein for the meal.</p>
<p>In some homes, noon is the time for the big meal of the day. In others, only at
night can the family gather around the dinner table. In still others, where everyone
is physically active, a big meal is needed both noon and night, and perhaps also at
breakfast. But whenever the meal, the hearty dishes described in this booklet will
help you to use a variety of economical foods to supply the protein your family needs.</p>
<p>If you cannot use the recipe exactly as stated, perhaps one of the suggested variations
will be suited to the foods you have at hand, your family preferences, or the facilities
you have for cooking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">Meat ...</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" id="ncfig2" alt="uncaptioned" width="171" height="95" />
</div>
<hr class="dwide" />
<p>Meat is too valuable, for its flavor and its protein, iron, and B vitamins, to waste
any of it. Part of the cook&rsquo;s skill is to make good use of every bit.</p>
<p>Cook meat bones with beans or soup to extract all possible flavor, and nutrients too.</p>
<p>Use rendered fats in gravies and sauces and ground cracklings in quick breads.</p>
<p>The following information on the yield from various cuts of meat will help you
decide how much to buy to get enough lean meat for a main-dish serving. It will also
help you figure the cost per serving.</p>
<p><i>Much bone or gristle</i>&mdash;a pound yields 1 to 2 servings. Examples are shank, brisket,
plate, short ribs, spareribs, breast of lamb or veal.</p>
<p><i>Medium amount of bone</i>&mdash;a pound yields 2 to 3 servings. Examples are whole or end
cuts of beef round, veal leg or shoulder, ham with bone in; also steaks, chops, or roasts
from the loin, rump, rib sections, or chuck.</p>
<p><i>Little bone</i>&mdash;a pound yields 3 to 4 servings. Examples are center cuts of beef round,
or ham; also lamb or veal cutlets.</p>
<p><i>No bone</i>&mdash;a pound yields 4 to 5 servings. Examples are ground meat, boneless stew
meats, liver or other variety or boneless meats.</p>
<h4>Buying Meat</h4>
<p>Homemakers who are after good buys at the meat counter will consider the grade
and the cut.</p>
<p>Federal grades of beef usually found on the market are Prime, Choice, Good,
Standard, and Commercial. Markets vary in the grades of beef carried and may
offer only one or two, as for example, U. S. Choice and U. S. Good. The lower
grades cost less per pound than similar cuts of higher grades and usually contain
more lean. Beef is the meat most often sold with a U. S. Grade stamp, but lamb,
mutton, veal, and calf are sometimes federally graded. Pork usually is not graded.</p>
<p>The cut refers to the part of the animal from which the meat comes. The buyer can
usually save money by using the less tender cuts of beef and the less popular cuts of
pork, lamb, and veal. These cuts cost less per pound but provide the same valuable
protein as the more expensive cuts. Variety meats, such as liver, heart, and kidney, also
provide high return in nutrition for money spent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>In comparing costs, consideration must be given to the amount of bone, fat, and
gristle because they affect the cost of the lean edible portion.</p>
<p>It pays to buy the cuts best suited to the cooking methods you use. Do you know
what to choose for pot roasts, stews, and soups? Here is a handy guide.</p>
<p><b>For pot roasts, Swiss steaks, smothered steaks, other braised meats.</b>&mdash;Beef
round, rump, sirloin tip, flank, chuck, short ribs, heart, and liver. Spareribs and ham
hocks. Pork liver and heart. Thick pork chops or ham slices or shoulder steaks.
Lamb shoulder, neck, breast, shanks, heart, and liver. Veal round, rump, shoulder,
and heart.</p>
<p><b>For stews, soups, or to cook before creaming or frying.</b>&mdash;Beef, lamb, or
veal neck. Beef plate and brisket (fresh or corned). Tongue (fresh or smoked).
Veal or lamb shanks, kidneys, brains. Pork kidneys and brains. Veal, lamb, or beef
sweetbreads.</p>
<h4>To Make Meat Tender</h4>
<p>Good cooking can help make any cut of meat a favorite main dish with the family.
Here are some of the methods that skillful cooks use for less tender cuts:</p>
<p><b>Long, slow cooking, as for braised meats and stews.</b>&mdash;For extra flavor first
brown meat in a little fat. To braise, use little or no liquid except the juices that cook
from the meat. Cook, closely covered, with low heat. To stew, add water to partially
cover meat, cover kettle, and simmer.</p>
<p><b>Chopping, pounding, scoring.</b>&mdash;The foodchopper helps make meat tender. After
chopping, any meat cooks as quickly as a tender cut. Pounding, or scoring with a
knife, before cooking is similar in effect to chopping but tenderizes meat less.</p>
<h4>Seasonings</h4>
<p>Meat itself is usually flavoring enough for the main dish. It is often browned in a
little fat to develop its flavor. In combination dishes, highly flavored or cured meats
such as ham, dried beef, corned beef, and sausage may lend more flavor than fresh meat.</p>
<p>When the meat is limited, other foods will add zest and additional food values. Tomatoes,
onions, parsley, chives, green peppers, celery, sour cream, lemon, nippy or
smoked cheese&mdash;all contribute in both ways.</p>
<p>Other seasonings your family may enjoy with meat are bay leaf, catsup, chili, curry,
garlic, marjoram, paprika, sage, soy sauce, sweet basil, tabasco sauce, thyme, worcestershire
sauce. Since these are used in small quantities, they are not expensive in the long
run.</p>
<p>Seasoning is especially important for meat-extending dishes. Meat loaves and other
dishes which combine meat with bland foods such as macaroni, rice, or potatoes depend
on skillful seasoning for their goodness.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" id="ncfig3" alt="uncaptioned" width="129" height="97" />
</div>
<hr class="dwide" />
<p>Like other meats, poultry has protein of high quality and is a good source of iron
and the B vitamin niacin.</p>
<p>In retail markets poultry is usually sold &ldquo;ready-to-cook&rdquo;; occasionally, &ldquo;dressed&rdquo;
or live. Ready-to-cook style comes either whole or cut up, and either freshly eviscerated
or frozen; some is labeled to show government inspection and grading, some
inspection only.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dressed&rdquo; means that only blood and feathers have been removed. &ldquo;Ready-to-cook&rdquo;
means that blood, feathers, head, feet, and viscera have been removed, and the bird has
been thoroughly cleaned inside and out.</p>
<p>Price per pound of a dressed bird includes weight of head, feet, and viscera. A
ready-to-cook bird is weighed and priced after this waste is removed. Therefore, though
the price per pound is lower for the dressed bird, the cost per pound of actual poultry
meat is about the same in the two styles.</p>
<p>Most chickens are sold in the following classes at these ages and weights:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr class="th"><th>Class </th><th>Age </th><th>Ready-to-cook weight</th></tr>
<tr><td class="l"> </td><td class="l"> </td><td class="l"><i>Pounds</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Broilers or fryers </td><td class="l">8 to 10 weeks </td><td class="l">1&frac12; to 2&frac12;.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Roasters </td><td class="l">3 to 5 months </td><td class="l">2&frac12; to 4&frac12;.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Stewing chickens </td><td class="l">over 10 months </td><td class="l">2 to 5&frac12;.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Stewing chickens&mdash;sometimes called &ldquo;fowl&rdquo; or &ldquo;hens&rdquo;&mdash;are hens old enough so that
the tip of the breastbone has hardened. They need long slow cooking with steam or
water to make the meat tender. They are often a good buy because they tend to have
a higher proportion of meat to bone than younger chickens. A 5-pound dressed hen
(3&frac34; pounds ready-to-cook) will give about 4 cups cooked meat coarsely cut, enough
for at least two meals for a family of four if extended dishes are used&mdash;10 to 11 servings
each containing 2 ounces of chicken.</p>
<p>Turkeys are sold in three classes based on weight and age: (1) Fryers or roasters,
(2) young hens and young toms, (3) hens and toms. A fryer-roaster turkey, or a
quarter or half of a larger turkey is often an economical roast, and can be made as
attractive as the traditional big bird.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h3 id="c20">Stewed or steamed whole chicken</h3>
<p>Prepare a fully drawn stewing
chicken for cooking: Pull out pin-feathers
and singe bird over flame; wash
well, rinse, and dry. Clean giblets.</p>
<p><i>Stewed Whole Chicken.</i>&mdash;Place the
bird on a rack in a kettle and add water
to half cover bird. Salt water lightly.
Cover kettle and simmer until chicken
is tender, turning occasionally for even
cooking. Three to 4 hours will probably
be needed.</p>
<p>Cook giblets with the chicken, removing
them as soon as done.</p>
<p>Cool chicken in broth, breast down, an
hour or more.</p>
<p>The cooked whole bird may be
browned with or without stuffing. Coat
it with fat, place it breast up on a rack
in a shallow open pan, and brown at
about 350&deg; F. (moderate oven).</p>
<p><i>Steamed Whole Chicken.</i>&mdash;Follow the
same general directions as for stewing,
but add water only to the level of the
rack in the kettle and keep the bird breast
up all the time. As the water boils away,
add more. Steaming time will be 2 to
3 hours.</p>
<h3 id="c21">Stewed or Steamed Chicken, in Pieces</h3>
<p>Cut a stewing chicken into pieces suitable
for serving. Simmer in water to
cover, or steam. Pieces take about as
long to cook as a whole bird.</p>
<h3 id="c22">Chicken with dumplings</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">1 stewing chicken cut in pieces and stewed</p>
<p class="t0">3 to 4 cups broth</p>
<p class="t0">6 tablespoons chicken fat</p>
<p class="t0">3 to 6 tablespoons flour</p>
<p class="t0">Salt and pepper</p>
</div>
<p>Remove pieces of chicken from the
broth and keep them hot. Skim
fat from broth.</p>
<p>Blend fat and flour, stir in several
spoonfuls of the broth, and pour the
mixture into the rest of the broth, stirring
constantly.</p>
<p>Cook this gravy until it is slightly
thickened. Season to taste.</p>
<h3 id="c23">Dumplings</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&frac34; cup sifted flour</p>
<p class="t0">2&frac12; teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p class="t0">&frac12; teaspoon salt</p>
<p class="t0">1 egg</p>
<p class="t0">&#8531; cup milk</p>
</div>
<p>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt
together.</p>
<p>Beat egg, add milk, and mix with the
dry ingredients.</p>
<p>Drop by small spoonfuls on boiling
chicken gravy, cover tightly, and cook
15 minutes. The cover must not be
removed while the dumplings are cooking,
for if the steam escapes they will not
be light.</p>

<p>Serve with broccoli or other green
vegetable, gelatin vegetable salad, date-and-nut
pudding.</p>

<p class="t0">1 pint chicken broth</p>
<p class="t0">&frac12; cup sliced onion</p>
<p class="t0">3 tablespoons flour</p>
<p class="t0">&frac14; teaspoon curry powder</p>
<p class="t0">2 cups cooked shredded carrots</p>
<p class="t0">Salt</p>
</div>
<p>Take cooked chicken from the broth.
Skim off fat and measure quantities
of fat and broth needed.</p>
<p>Make sauce: Cook onion in fat for a
few minutes. Blend in flour and curry
powder. Add broth, and cook until
smooth and thickened, stirring constantly.</p>
<p>Mix chicken and carrots with sauce.
Add salt to taste.</p>
<p>Leftover cooked lamb, pork, or veal
may be used instead of chicken.</p>
<h4>Menu Suggestion</h4>
<p>Serve with a border of flaky rice and
a green vegetable. Start the meal with
tomato juice and have fruit sundae for
dessert.</p>
<p>For a company meal pass a relish dish
of several of the following: Chopped
hard-cooked eggs, chopped peanuts, sweet
pickle relish, finely diced celery, chopped
raw onion. Include shredded fresh
coconut, too, if you live where it is
available and inexpensive. Guests can
sprinkle these tidbits over the rice and
chicken as desired.</p>
<h3 id="c25">Roast turkey quarter or half</h3>
<p>You can roast turkey quarters or
halves stuffed or unstuffed.</p>
<p>Rub inside of cleaned turkey part with
salt. To keep meat from drying, fasten
skin with skewers over meat at bone edge
all around cavity. Or with big needle and
heavy cord, lace across cavity, catching the
skin with each stitch.</p>
<p>On a front quarter or half, sew wing
tightly to body or fasten with skewers
put in firmly at an angle. On a rear
quarter or half, sew drumstick to tail.</p>
<p>Stuffing may be baked separately while
the turkey cooks or, if preferred, quarters
or halves may be stuffed and then roasted.
Use heavy paper to hold stuffing in place
and lace cord across paper from side to
side, catching skin with each stitch.</p>
<p>Place turkey part, skin side up, on a
rack in roasting pan. Cover with thin
greased cloth or brush skin with fat. Do
not add water. Do not cover pan. Roast
at 325&deg; F. (slow oven), basting several
times with drippings.</p>
<p>Quarters weighing 3&frac12; to 5 pounds require
3 to 3&frac12; hours to roast; those weighing
5 to 8 pounds, 3&frac12; to 4 hours. A half
turkey weighing 7 to 9 pounds ready-to-cook
takes 3&frac34; to 4&frac12; hours. A larger
half-bird takes longer.</p>
<p><i>Serve with</i> mashed potatoes or turnips,
snap beans, cranberry relish, and fruit
or fruit pie.</p>

<hr class="dwide" />
<p>You can often save time and money by purchasing meat that will serve for two or
more meals. Buy a smoked pork shoulder, a pot roast, or a stewing hen and plan
your menus for several days around it.</p>
<p>Since meat is one of our more expensive foods, you may want to economize by reducing
the size of meat servings. But meat is one of our best-liked foods. We want
to keep the savory meat flavor in main dishes and provide enough protein in the family
diet, too. Fortunately, both economy and sturdy meat servings can be achieved by wise
use of meat-extending main dishes, using cooked and canned meats.</p>
<p>Least expensive of the meat extenders are the cereal foods&mdash;breadcrumbs in meat loaf,
biscuit topping on a chicken pie, macaroni with meat in Italian-style dishes, rice cooked
in chicken stock as in chicken risotto. The meat protein supplements the protein in the
cereals and the result is a nutritious main dish.</p>
<p>Or you may want to extend a comparatively small amount of cooked meat with other
high-protein foods such as milk, eggs, or cheese. These are the makings of such main
dishes as creamed lamb, ham and egg scramble, or a beef and vegetable casserole with
grated cheese on top.</p>
<p>When there is too little meat left for the basis of a main dish, use these small amounts
for flavor and whatever protein they give. Try bits of cooked meats or poultry to season
scalloped potatoes, macaroni, soups, salads, or sandwich spreads. Chop crusty
brown chicken or turkey skin and add to gravy or a casserole mixture.</p>
<p>Some of the cooked luncheon meats are relatively low-priced and are as protein-rich
as many of the more expensive meats. For example, a pound of bologna has as much
protein as a pound of smoked ham and even a little more than a pound of beef with a
moderate amount of bone and fat. Some of the canned meats provide economical main
dishes, too, especially when extended with other foods.</p>
<p>Cool quickly any leftover meat, broth, or gravy (set pan in iced or very cold water);
refrigerate at once. Store in the coldest part of the refrigerator. Cooked meat loses
flavor quickly; cover or wrap loosely and plan to use within 1 or 2 days. Broth, gravy,
and sauce made with meat are highly perishable. Store these covered and use within
1 or 2 days.</p>
<p>On the following pages are suggestions for extended dishes using cooked and canned
meat and poultry. Other recipes will be found in the section on cereal foods.</p>

<hr class="dwide" />
<p>Fish&mdash;fresh, frozen, canned, or salted&mdash;provides high-quality protein.
And it lends interesting flavor and variety to meal planning.</p>
<p>Different kinds of fish vary greatly in price per pound. Some cost twice as much as
others, depending on the season, local supply, and the preference of buyers.</p>
<p>Fresh fish may be whole, drawn, dressed, or in fillets or steaks. Whole fish are sold
as they are caught. Drawn fish have only the viscera removed. Dressed fish have the
viscera, head, tail, and usually the fins removed. Fillets are boneless slices of fish cut
lengthwise away from the backbone. Steaks are crosswise slices, usually &frac34; to 1 inch
thick, still including bones.</p>
<p>There is no bone or waste in fish fillets, and very little in fish steaks&mdash;only about 9
percent. Dressed whole fish may be cheaper per pound but remember that they include
considerable waste.</p>
<p>To provide the suggested 2 ounces of protein for 4 servings of a main dish, you will
usually need to buy 2 pounds of whole fish. The exact amount needed depends on the
kind of fish and the amount of waste in cleaning. It takes only 1 pound of boneless
fillets or steaks to provide enough protein for 4 servings.</p>
<p>Some fish contain more fat than others. Fat fish are usually best for baking and
broiling. And lean fish are better for cooking in water or steam or for making chowders,
and for deep-fat or pan frying.</p>
<p>Frozen fish are a boon to inlanders. They give us the fish we want at any time of
year. And the flavor is fresh. Before cooking a frozen fish, thaw it slowly if there is
time&mdash;in a refrigerator or other cold place. If you are in a hurry, cook it slowly for a
longer period. Never permit frozen fish to thaw and refreeze.</p>
<p>Canned fish is economical and convenient for family meals. It can be chilled and
served in salads or on cold plate lunches with little further preparation. For cooked
dishes, the brine or oil in which the fish is packed can often be used to add flavor and
nutritive value to the sauce.</p>
<p>Salmon is ordinarily available in several different quality grades and is packed in
brine. Mackerel also is packed in brine. Tuna fish may be had in solid-pack, chunk,
or grated style, packed in oil or brine. Flaked fish&mdash;cod, haddock, pollack, or a combination&mdash;is
ordinarily packed dry. Small domestic sardines packed in oil, mustard
sauce, or tomato sauce are gaining market prominence.</p>

<img src="images/p06.jpg" id="ncfig6" alt="uncaptioned" width="136" height="126" />

<hr class="dwide" />
<p>Eggs are excellent for main dishes because they contain high-quality protein, and
are a good source of several important minerals and vitamins. When you serve
eggs as an alternate for meat in a main dish, either allow more than 1 egg per person
or add enough milk or cheese, as in cheese omelet, for example, to make up the difference.</p>
<p>Government-graded eggs are sold in cartons labeled with the grade (quality), size
(weight), and date of grading. There are four U. S. grades&mdash;AA, A, B, and C. Grades
AA and A have a large proportion of thick white, a firm high yolk, and a delicate flavor.
They are often preferred for cooking in the shell, poaching, and frying. Grades B and
C, which are less expensive than the two top grades, are a thrifty choice where appearance
and delicate flavor are less important, as in Spanish omelet, gingerbread, or scrambled
eggs with bacon.</p>
<p>Sizes of eggs and their minimum weights per dozen are:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="l">Jumbo </td><td class="l">30 ounces</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Extra large </td><td class="l">27 ounces</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Large </td><td class="l">24 ounces</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Medium </td><td class="l">21 ounces</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Small </td><td class="l">18 ounces</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Peewee </td><td class="l">15 ounces</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Within any grade, large eggs usually cost more per dozen than smaller ones. Use
the above weights to determine which size gives you the best return for your money.
For instance, if medium eggs weighing 21 ounces are 56 cents a dozen (2&#8532; cents an
ounce) they are a better buy than large eggs weighing 24 ounces at 66 cents a dozen
(2&frac34; cents an ounce).</p>
<p>Eggs are cheaper than meat as a source of main-dish protein when the price of eight
large eggs is less than the price of a pound of meat with moderate amounts of bone and
fat, such as rump roast. Or when the price of a dozen large eggs is less than the
price of a pound of lean meat with little fat and bone, as round steak.</p>
<p>The color of the eggshell depends on the breed of hen and does not indicate the
food value of the eggs. So do not pay a higher price for brown eggs than for white
ones, or vice versa, with the idea that you are getting more food value.</p>

<hr class="dwide" />
<p>Cheese is one of the most popular alternates for meat. Like meat and eggs, it
contains high-quality protein and is an excellent supplement for the protein in bread
and such other cereal foods as macaroni, noodles, and spaghetti.</p>
<p>Cheese is not equal in food value to the milk from which it is made. It contains one
of the milk proteins but the other is separated out when cheese is made and is left in
the whey.</p>
<p>American Cheddar, sometimes called American or &ldquo;store&rdquo; cheese, is the cheese most
commonly used in cooking in this country. It is sold in natural and processed forms,
and varies in flavor from mild to very sharp. Other cheeses are noted for their distinctive
flavors and are chiefly used for garnishing, as the grated hard Parmesan, or for
eating alone, as the sweet Swiss and Brick or the salty Bleu and Gouda.</p>
<p>You can count on half a pound of Cheddar cheese (2 cups chopped or grated) to give
you enough protein for 4 servings of a main dish, or about the same amount of protein
as a pound of meat with a moderate amount of bone and fat.</p>
<p>Because Cheddar cheese is a concentrated food, it is generally used in relatively small
amounts&mdash;less than half a pound for 4 servings. Then other protein-rich foods are
added to the meal or included in the cheese dish to increase the protein content, as milk
and eggs added to the cheese for a souffle or an omelet.</p>
<p>Cottage cheese is less concentrated than Cheddar cheese, with only four-fifths as
much protein per pound. In using cottage cheese as a meat alternate, use about a
fourth more by weight than you would of Cheddar cheese. For instance, it would take
10 ounces of cottage cheese (compared with 8 ounces of Cheddar cheese) to alternate
for a pound of beef with a moderate amount of fat and bone. Ten ounces of cottage
cheese measure about 1&frac14; cups; a pound measures a little more than 2 cups.</p>
<p>We lean heavily on milk as a source of our day&rsquo;s protein. But it takes almost 7 cups
of fluid milk, or about 2 cups of nonfat dry milk, to provide enough protein for 4
servings of a main dish. So, although we sometimes use a milk soup or chowder as
the main dish, we are more likely to spread our milk consumption throughout the
day&mdash;in beverages, custards, or milk puddings. In many recipes, we can increase the
milk value by using fluid and dry milk together.</p>

<hr class="dwide" />
<p>There are dozens of varieties of beans and peas, and for centuries they have been
important in the diets of many peoples. In this country, varieties grown and used
in some sections are practically unknown in others. The South has its blackeye peas
and black beans, the East and Middle West have their pea beans, soybeans, and kidney
beans, and the Southwest and West like pinto beans and chickpeas.</p>
<p>Beans and peas contain proteins that are not well balanced by themselves and need
to be supplemented with high-quality protein in the same meal. When you serve beans
as the main dish, you can increase the quality and quantity of protein in the meal by
adding a little meat or cheese. This is done in many famous national bean dishes.
For example, ham or smoked sausage is often added to split-pea soup and grated cheese
is used to garnish beans.</p>
<p>When you serve beans alone as the main dish, you need to cook about 1&#8531; cups,
or a little more than 9 ounces of dry navy beans, to provide the amount of protein recommended
for 4 servings. This makes about 3 cups of cooked beans, or four &frac34;-cup
servings. If you do not use this amount or do not add other protein food to the bean
dish, remember to supplement the protein elsewhere in the meal, perhaps with an egg
salad or baked custard.</p>
<p>Soybean protein is of higher quality than protein of most beans commonly used in
this country. For high nutritive value and distinctive flavor from your food dollar, use
soybeans sometimes instead of navy or lima beans in favorite bean recipes, or use some
soy flour in making breads and hot breads.</p>
<p>Split peas provide slightly more protein than an equal weight or measure of dry
beans except soybeans. Try thick hot split-pea soup for the main dish on a cold
winter day.</p>
<p>Beans and peas are economical protein foods. You will generally find that a protein
dish made up partly of beans and providing an equal quantity of protein averages less
in cost than one made up entirely of meat.</p>
<p>To soak dry beans and whole peas, boil them 2 minutes in the soaking water first,
to help prevent fermentation and hardening of skins. An hour of soaking is enough
after boiling, but overnight may be more convenient. Cook beans in the soaking water
for best flavor and highest nutritive value. Split peas do not need soaking.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" id="ncfig9" alt="uncaptioned" width="139" height="131" />

<hr class="dwide" />
<p>Bread and other cereal foods are truly the staff of life for some families and are
used for all or part of the main dish for many of their meals. Griddlecakes, toast,
or oatmeal is a favorite breakfast dish. And sandwiches, spaghetti, or macaroni may
form the bulk of a noon or evening meal.</p>
<p>Bread and other cereal foods do not provide large amounts of protein in any one
serving. But, because we eat bread and other cereals so often, grain foods contribute
a fourth of the protein in diets in this country. The cereal foods also contribute to our
diets more calories, more iron, and more thiamine than any other group of foods.</p>
<p>Grains cannot make an adequate main dish unless eaten in large quantities or combined
with protein-rich foods.</p>
<p>A few figures on grain proteins may be helpful. A pound loaf of whole-wheat bread
contains a little less than three-fourths as much protein as a pound of beef with a moderate
amount of fat and bone. You would need to eat one-third of the loaf, seven or
eight slices, for as much protein as you get in a fourth pound of the meat&mdash;an average
serving.</p>
<p>A pound loaf of white bread contains somewhat less protein than a pound whole-wheat
loaf. The use of nonfat dry milk solids in bread increases quantity and quality
of proteins slightly.</p>
<p>Proteins from bread and other cereal foods are not of as high quality as proteins of
animal products, although some are better than others. You can somewhat increase the
protein values obtained from cereals by using whole-wheat bread and whole-grain
breakfast cereals and by adding corn germ or wheat germ to other cereals. Milk, eggs,
soy flour or grits, meat, or fish help to bring up the protein content and protein value
of a cereal main dish.</p>
<p>Familiar examples of the cereal-extended main dishes are creamed chicken or fish&mdash;or
meat in brown sauce&mdash;served with toast, noodles, spaghetti, rice, or hominy grits.
Other popular combinations of cereals with high-protein foods are scrapple, macaroni
or rice with cheese, eggs with toast, and meat loaf or patties with breadcrumbs. And
we are also extending high-protein foods with cereals when we add biscuit to the meat
stew, dumplings to stewed chicken, and waffles to the breakfast or supper sausages.</p>

<h2 id="c74"><span class="small">Lunch-box main dishes ...</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" id="ncfig10" alt="uncaptioned" width="133" height="151" />
</div>
<hr class="dwide" />
<p>Packing a really good lunch-box meal&mdash;one that is high in important food values
and in appetite appeal&mdash;takes more careful planning than many a meal that goes
on the family table. For lunch-box foods are necessarily limited to those that can be
held for several hours without spoiling or losing their freshness. But there are foods
that pack well, and ways to vary them, so packed lunches need not be monotonous.</p>
<p>Sandwiches tend to be the &ldquo;backbone&rdquo; of the lunch-box meal. And when the fillings
are high in protein foods&mdash;meats, eggs, cheese, fish, peanut butter, baked beans&mdash;they
really are main dishes. To increase the protein value of these sandwiches, be generous
with the filling. One-fourth cup of filling, spread clear to the edge of the bread, or 2
slices of meat or cheese, is not too much. Salmon or egg salad on a roll is a better main
dish and more appetizing if part of the roll is scooped out to make room for more filling.
Use centers as bread crumbs.</p>
<p>Provide variety in sandwiches by using different kinds of bread. For instance,
&ldquo;cheese on rye&rdquo; is a favorite, but cheese on raisin bread or Boston brown bread may be
a welcome change.</p>
<p>Vary the fillings&mdash;spread salad dressing or prepared mustard, topped with sliced
cucumber or a lettuce leaf, over the meat or cheese; spread a thin layer of jelly over the
peanut butter. Try different kinds of cheese. Or make a cheese spread: Put cheese
through the food chopper and add jam or mashed cooked fruit, or salad dressing with
chopped onion or sweet pickle.</p>
<p>For food value and variety, pack a salad of raw fruits or vegetables with the sandwich
lunch. If the sandwiches are a little low in protein, include cottage cheese in the
salad. Even with dressing and greens, salad travels well in a covered container of paper,
glass, or plastic.</p>
<p>Hot soups, stews, or chowders&mdash;made with meats, fish, or beans&mdash;are good winter
additions to the sandwich lunch. An individual-size insulated bottle or wide-mouth
container for them may be a good investment, if these hot dishes cannot be bought at
school or at work.</p>
<p>Moist, soft sandwich filling or salad mixtures made with finely chopped meat, eggs,
or fish with salad dressing spoil quickly when temperatures are high. Refrigerate all
such mixtures immediately after buying or making them and use them within 2 days.
Lunches containing these mixtures are best refrigerated if they have to stand more than
3 or 4 hours before they are eaten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h3 id="c75">Salads</h3>
<p><i>Ham and Egg.</i>&mdash;For each serving, use
1 chopped hard-cooked egg, &frac14; cup
chopped cooked ham. Add onion, celery,
green pepper, pickle, and salad dressing
to taste.</p>
<p><i>Meat and Macaroni.</i>&mdash;Mix equal parts
of cooked meat and macaroni. Add
chopped pickles and celery and moisten
with salad dressing.</p>
<p><i>Meat and Bean.</i>&mdash;Use shredded
chipped beef, or chopped cooked corned
beef. Mix with any kind of cooked dry
beans; add diced onion and tart dressing.</p>
<p><i>Potato With Meat.</i>&mdash;Mix cut-up ham
or crumbled bacon with potatoes. Add
cut-up pickles, celery, onion, and salad
dressing.</p>
<p><i>Meat and Fruit.</i>&mdash;Mix any cut-up
cooked meat with celery and raisins or
raw dried apricots. Add salt and salad
dressing as needed.</p>
<p><i>Egg and Beet.</i>&mdash;Combine sliced hard-cooked
eggs and pickled beets. Add
shredded endive or other salad greens.
Pack dressing separately.</p>
<p><i>Kidney Bean.</i>&mdash;Combine drained
cooked kidney beans, cut-up celery, dill
pickles, and cubed cheese. Add mayonnaise.</p>
<p><i>Fish</i>.&mdash;Shred leftover cooked fish&mdash;halibut,
salmon, or sardines. Combine
with cut-up celery, cooked peas, lemon
juice, and salad dressing.</p>
<p><i>Chicken.</i>&mdash;Mix equal parts of cut-up
cooked chicken and crisp celery. Add
salad dressing and thin slices of sweet
pickle or stuffed olives.</p>
<h3 id="c76">Sandwich fillings</h3>
<p><i>Sliced Meat or Cheese.</i>&mdash;Use two
slices with vegetables between. Good
combinations are: Beef with parsley or
thinly sliced tomato and salad dressing;
tongue with watercress and salad dressing
or prepared mustard; cheese with
either of the above combinations, or with
jam, jelly, or marmalade.</p>
<p><i>Bacon.</i>&mdash;Crumble crisp fried bacon,
and add it to one of the following: Cottage
cheese, sliced tomato, diced hard-cooked
egg, raw carrots, onion, sweet or
dill pickles.</p>
<p><i>Baked Bean.</i>&mdash;Mash cold baked beans
and moisten with thick chili sauce. Add
diced sweet pickle and thinly sliced onion
or cucumber.</p>
<p><i>Peanut Butter.</i>&mdash;Mix equal parts of
peanut butter and chopped raisins or
other raw dried fruit. Or, mix the peanut
butter with diced pickle and
chopped onion.</p>
<p><i>Cheese Salad.</i>&mdash;Dice cheese fine. Add
a little chopped onion and green pepper
or parsley, season, and moisten with
salad dressing.</p>
<p><i>Cottage Cheese.</i>&mdash;Mix cottage cheese
with cut-up celery, a little grated carrot,
diced pickles, and nuts.</p>
<p><i>Fish.</i>&mdash;Mix flaked cooked fish with
chopped cabbage, salad dressing, and salt
to taste. Or mash sardines with hard-cooked
egg.</p>
<p><i>Egg.</i>&mdash;Combine diced hard-cooked
egg, celery, and pickles with prepared
mustard and salad dressing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h3 id="c77">Other main dishes for the lunch box</h3>
<p><i>Hot Soup.</i>&mdash;Add thin slices of frankfurter
or Vienna sausage to split-pea or
bean soup. Pack some cheese to go with
vegetable or cream soup or corn chowder.
Heat soups very hot; pack in insulated
container.</p>
<p><i>Meat Stews.</i>&mdash;A favorite stew with
vegetables and gravy, kept hot in an insulated
container until lunch time, is a
welcome winter dish.</p>
<p><i>Baked Beans, Corned Beef Hash,
Creamed Meats, or Eggs.</i>&mdash;These are cold-weather
dishes. Pack hot in special insulated
container.</p>
<p><i>Cheese.</i>&mdash;A large slice of cheese or
serving of cottage cheese teams well with
fruit in summer lunches.</p>
<p><i>Deviled Eggs.</i>&mdash;Mash, season, and
moisten hard-cooked egg yolks as usual.
Add finely chopped peanuts or cooked
meat before stuffing the egg whites with
the yolk mixture.</p>
<p><i>Chicken or Chop.</i>&mdash;Yesterday&rsquo;s drumstick
or pork chop makes a main dish to
eat out of hand.</p>
<p><i>Sliced Meat.</i>&mdash;Spread two slices of ham
or other meat with chopped vegetables
and salad dressing. Roll, and fasten with
toothpicks.</p>
<p><i>Smoked Fish.</i>&mdash;Bone and skin pieces;
pack by themselves. Drain oil-packed
sardines; wrap well.</p>
<p><i>Luncheon Meats.</i>&mdash;Many ready-to-serve
meats&mdash;liver sausage, bologna, salami,
spiced meat loaves&mdash;give as high protein
value per pound as fresh meats. Keep
cold, add to lunch last.</p>
<h3 id="c78">To complete the lunch-box meal</h3>
<p>Plan the lunch-box meal to include contrasts
in flavors and textures. It is more
appetizing when it contains something
moist to offset the dry foods, tart foods to
offset the sweet, and crisp foods as well
as soft.</p>
<p><i>Relishes.</i>&mdash;Raw vegetables and pickles
add crispness to the sandwich lunch. Try
carrot and celery sticks, pieces of cauliflower
or turnip, sliced cucumber or
onion, or crisp lettuce leaves rolled
together.</p>
<p><i>Desserts.</i>&mdash;With soup or salad, use cake
or cookies for contrast. If the main dish
is sandwiches, choose a juicy fresh fruit.</p>
<p>Fresh fruits are easy to pack and popular.
As a change from the often-used
apples, oranges, and bananas, try plums,
grapes, and pears in season.</p>
<p>Baked and canned fruits travel well in
covered containers&mdash;glass, plastic, or
paper. Try an occasional baked pear or
peach, as well as apple.</p>
<p>Sweet fruit desserts like pie or fruitcake
or fruit-filled cookies taste best after a
tart salad or a milk-flavored soup.</p>
<p>Baked custards are good to use when
the main dish is low in protein. It is best
not to use cake with cream filling, or
cream pie or cream puffs. The fillings
spoil easily in hot weather, or even in
winter if the lunch is not kept in a cool
place.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
